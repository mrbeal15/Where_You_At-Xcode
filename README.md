##About the project
Where You At is an iOS on Rails app which allows you to join groups with other users so you can see where all your friends are on a map at any given time while you're out on the town or at a concert. This was our 7-day final project at Dev Bootcamp in which we utilized the following technologies: Ruby, Rails, Swift, xCode, AlamoFire, SwiftyJSON and Heroku. Since we were learning a new language and new IDE, we spent most of our time pair programming and learning together. 

##Tech Stack
Xcode, Swift, Cocoa Pods, Ruby on RailsSwiftyJSON, Alamofire, Heroku
